# Data science/machine learning portfolio
## Profile
Hi, I am an experienced software engineering researcher in semantic information architecture. Currently, my interest is in the fantastic subject area of data science/machine learning and its applications in business context. My hobbies include international relations, cricket, badminton and reading, and care for the differently abled individuals.
